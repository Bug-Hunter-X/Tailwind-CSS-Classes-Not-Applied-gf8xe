The solution involves ensuring that Tailwind CSS is correctly configured and integrated into your project.  This typically includes:

1. **Correct installation:** Verify that Tailwind CSS is installed using the correct npm or yarn command (npm install -D tailwindcss postcss autoprefixer). 
2. **Configuration file:**  Ensure that the `tailwind.config.js` file is correctly configured to include the paths to your HTML files. 
3. **Import directives:** Make sure that the necessary `@tailwind` directives are correctly placed in your CSS file. 
4. **Build process:** If using a build process (like Vite, Webpack etc.), verify that the build process correctly includes the Tailwind CSS directives. 

Here's an example of a correctly configured `tailwind.config.js` file:

```javascript
/** @type {import('tailwindcss').Config} */
module.exports = {
  content: [ "./src/**/*.{html,js}"],
  theme: {
    extend: {},
  },
  plugins: [],
}
```

And an example of the correctly styled HTML:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
  <title>Tailwind Example</title>
  <link href="output.css" rel="stylesheet">
</head>
<body>
  <div class="bg-red-500 p-4">
    This text should have a red background and padding.
  </div>
</body>
</html>
```

Remember to generate your CSS file using `npx tailwindcss -i ./src/input.css -o ./dist/output.css --watch` (adjust file paths as needed).
