The following Tailwind CSS code is expected to style a div with a red background and padding, but it doesn't work as expected:

```html
<div class="bg-red-500 p-4">
  This text should have a red background and padding.
</div>
```

The issue is that the `bg-red-500` and `p-4` classes are not applied.  The problem is that the Tailwind directives are not being processed, resulting in the classes being treated as plain text and having no effect. This might be due to the configuration of Tailwind itself, or the way it is included in your project.
